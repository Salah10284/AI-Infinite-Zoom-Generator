# Generating Zoom Animations from AI Outpainting
This python program can turn a bunch of AI generated images into a zoom animation. Currently it is expecting Midjourney images as input that were
created using the 2x zoom option. 

Please note: This is project a work in progress!

## What is AI Outpainting?
Before you can use this script you have to create a set outpainted ai images. Outpainting is a technique were you
create an image with a generative AI and then you zoom this image out by a given zoom factor and let the AI fill
the newly created empty border.

The outpainting requires the use of a generative AI for images and can be done with Midjourney, by Dall-E or with Photoshop.
I only ever tested this command line script on midjourney images since they are easiest to create.
